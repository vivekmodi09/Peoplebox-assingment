Documentation of Approach and Assumptions
This code utilizes the following assumptions and approaches:

1. Assumptions:

The input data contains consistent and accurate information about employee records.
Missing values in compensation, engagement, and review data can be reasonably approximated by inheriting values from the previous record.
The far-future date (2100-01-01) is an acceptable representation for the end date of the latest record for each employee.
2. Approach:

The code calculates Effective Date and End Date for each record, ensuring end dates fall one day before the next effective date to prevent overlap.
It transforms the data into a row-based format, representing each period with consistent data points.
Missing values are filled by inheriting data from the most recent past record for the same employee.
Unchanged values in non-date related fields are preserved across different records.

The output data is accurate, but in the output.csv format, the date should not be in the year-month format.
The final output is a CSV file suitable for further analysis and reporting.
